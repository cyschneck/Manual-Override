  missionText: "The Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) are Jupiter\u2019s
    four largest moons. The inner three moons (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) orbit Jupiter
    in a resonance pattern (for every 1 orbit around Jupiter that Ganymede undergoes,
    Europa undergoes 2 orbits, and Io undergoes 4). Io is an active volcanic world.
    Europa and Ganymede are believed to have a large liquid ocean below their surface.
    NASA is sending a spacecraft (Europa Clipper) to Europa to look for evidence
    of life in the subsurface ocean"
